            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, Gujarat. He was the fourth of six children in his family. Patel exhibited leadership qualities from a young age and was known for his resilience and determination. After completing his primary education, he went on to study law in England, where he qualified as a barrister.</p>
            <p>Upon returning to India, Patel became actively involved in the independence movement, inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. He played a crucial role in organizing peasants in Gujarat to revolt against oppressive policies and practices of the British authorities. His leadership during the Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928 earned him the title "Sardar," meaning leader or chief.</p>
            <p>Patel was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and worked closely with other leaders to strategize the fight for freedom. He was arrested multiple times by the British authorities but remained undeterred. His commitment to the cause of independence never wavered.</p>
            <p>After India gained independence in 1947, Patel became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs. His most significant contribution during this period was the political integration of India. He successfully persuaded over 500 princely states to join the Indian Union, ensuring the country's unity and stability.</p>
            <p>Patel's efforts in building a strong administrative foundation for the newly independent nation were instrumental. He was also responsible for establishing the All India Services, which laid the groundwork for a unified civil service system in India.</p>
            <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel passed away on 15 December 1950, leaving behind a legacy of unity, integrity, and nation-building. His contributions to India are commemorated through various institutions and the Statue of Unity, which stands as a tribute to his enduring legacy.</p>
